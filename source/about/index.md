Hello! This is Q ~~speaking~~ writing!

## About This Site

- This is my personal blog built with [Hexo](https://hexo.io).
- Deployed on **GitHub Pages** with **GitHub Actions**.
- Previously built with [Ayer](https://github.com/shen-yu/hexo-theme-ayer) theme but it is no longer maintained because the author changed his career as a programmer and I was abandoned :(
- But heroes never die, now reincarnated with [Volantis](https://volantis.js.org/) theme!
- I'm trying to make everything simple and this is the result.
- I also had a personal website with some web apps I developed. 
- Why "had"? => Not enough minerals, it looks like I have to work harder to pay for cloud servers.
